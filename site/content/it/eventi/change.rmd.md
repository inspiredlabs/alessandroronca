### Does your _comfort zone_ still bring peace of mind?
#### Description

Change is different for everyone. Although, we all desire some sort of transformation.

<!--#### Reason to participate-->

#### We share our practical tools

- Planning exercises with people who have implemented alternatives for themselves.
- Help interpreting opportunities that can broaden your horizons.
- Get to know people in the same situation.

#### Course objectives

- Gain hands-on experience with the future and connect with nature. The course takes place in a tranquil forest, where changes are being implemented&nbsp;now.
- Review together important parts of the "Bureau of Detachment".
- Analyse how conventional thinking, money and your beliefs affect you.
