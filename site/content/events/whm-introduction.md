#### How I discovered The Wim Hof Method

When I read Wim Hof's _The force of the cold_, it inspired me to practice – and after a short while, I felt unusually energetic. I embraced this "internal technology" practice and soon my new routine displaced seasonal depression.

Beforehand, my work focused on external technologies, such as engineering and building. Now, I began to understand how transformative energy comes from within. This experience has helped me develop new levels of creativity and well-being.

#### Course Background

**The elements** are an extreme combination of blistering cold, spontaneous heat and perilous dangers.

Throughout billions of years the elements have shaped evolution. Our species is no exception. These energies define life's capability to adapt, resist and heal. Mostly, they remain dormant, due to the comforts of daily life.
 <!--and environmental conveniences.-->

These comforts have now become more dangerous than _the elements_. It seems we often submit to weakness and that sickness can overpower us. If you are convinced your mind can not be changed – you need this the most.

To access our formidable potential _we must connect with nature_.

#### The Wim Hof Method Origin

Wim Hof, a Dutch Athlete and Trainer has distilled nature's "way" into a succinct "method". The idea is simple, with three fundamental pillars: cold exposure, focus and breathing,

The method connects us to our true nature, educating the body to awaken it's healing strength.

#### The Wim Hof Method Benefits

The method is a athletic performance enhancer, improving strength, endurance and mental awareness.
It is the antidote to the frantic, distracting rhythm of modern life.

#### The Wim Hof Method Course at **PeR**

#### The Wim Hof Method in a natural fresh water spring

The crystal clear waters of _Il Solarium sul Fiume Nera_. The natural fresh water spring is emerald green due to the presence of copper salts. The site is owned by a [hydro-electric plant](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Centrale+Idroelettrica+Stifone&t=ffab&ia=images) due to the pool being used as an overflow, which can increase the current.
