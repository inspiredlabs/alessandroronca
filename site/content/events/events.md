#### How I discovered The Wim Hof Method

When I read Wim Hof's _The force of the cold_, it inspired me to practice – and after a short while, I felt unusually energetic. I embraced my new routine and "internal technology" practice soon displaced seasonal depression.

Beforehand, my work focused on external technologies, such as engineering and building. Now, I began to understand how transformative energy comes from within. This experience has helped me develop new levels of creativity and well-being.

### Background to The Wim Hof Method

#### The elements

Nature is an extreme combination of blistering cold, spontaneous heat and perilous dangers.

Throughout billions of years _the elements_ have shaped evolution. Our species is no exception. Energies shaping evolution define life's capability to adapt, resist and heal. For us, the are dormant due to the comforts of daily life.
 <!--and environmental conveniences.-->

It seems, the comforts of daily life have become more dangerous than _the elements_. They are constructed to submit to weakness and that sickness will overpower us. If you are convinced your mind can not be changed – you need this the most.

To access our formidable potential we must connect with nature.

#### The Wim Hof Method Course Origin

Wim Hof, a Dutch athlete and trainer has distilled nature's "way" into a succinct "method". The idea is simple, with three fundamental pillars: cold exposure, focus and breathing,

The method connects us to our true nature, educating the body to awaken it's healing strength.

#### The Wim Hof Method in a natural fresh water spring

The crystal clear waters of _Il Solarium sul Fiume Nera_. The natural fresh water spring is emerald green due to the presence of copper salts. Rumours of the site being dangerous are due to the pool being used as an overflow, which increases the current by the [hydro-electric plant](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Centrale+Idroelettrica+Stifone&t=ffab&ia=images).
