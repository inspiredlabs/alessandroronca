Nature is an extreme combination of blistering cold, spontaneous heat and perilous dangers.

Throughout billions of years _the elements_ have shaped evolution. Our species is no exception. Energies shaping evolution define life's capability to adapt, resist and heal. For us, the are dormant due to the comforts of daily life.
 <!--and environmental conveniences.-->

There is something more dangerous than _the elements_: comfort. It convinces us being sick or weak can overpower us. If you feel like that – you need this the most.

To access our formidable potential we must connect with nature.

#### Course Origin
