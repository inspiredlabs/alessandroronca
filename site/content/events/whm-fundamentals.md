### An introduction to: The Wim Hof Method, Fundamentals

Introductory courses are held from February 2020. Courses lead people to appreciate, first-hand _the regenerative potential of The Wim Hof Method_.


### How I discovered The Wim Hof Method

When I read Wim Hof's _The force of the cold_, it inspired me to practice – and after a short while, I felt unusually energetic. I embraced this "inner technology" practice, and soon my new routine displaced seasonal depression.

Beforehand, my work focused on external technologies, such as engineering. Now, I began to understand how transformative energy comes from within. This experience has helped me develop new levels of creativity and well-being.

### Course Background

The elements are an extreme combination of blistering cold, spontaneous heat and <!--nature's--> perilous dangers.

Throughout billions of years _the elements_ have shaped evolution. Our species is no exception. These energies define life's capability to adapt, resist and heal. Mostly, they remain dormant, due to the comforts of daily life.
 <!--and environmental conveniences.-->

Comfort has become more dangerous than _the elements_. It seems we often submit to weakness and that sickness can overpower us. If you are convinced your mind can not be changed – you need this the most.

To access our formidable potential _we must connect with nature_.

### **The Wim Hof ​​Method** Origin

Wim Hof, a Dutch Athlete and Trainer has distilled nature's "way" into a succinct "method". The idea is simple, with three fundamental pillars: cold exposure, focus and breathing,

### **The Wim Hof ​​Method** Benefits

The method is a athletic performance enhancer, improving strength, endurance and mental awareness.
It is the antidote to the frantic, distracting rhythm of modern life.

### **The Wim Hof ​​Method** has made me more ambitious than ever

Since beginning **The Wim Hof ​​Method**, my body and mind work in harmony – I'm feeling more effective than ever.

Taking an experimental approach, I am gathering a team for my most ambitious project to date: [The Fairtech Revolution](https://rvo.lt/). This challenges conventional thinking by being inventive with fewer resources.

Modernity relies on external technologies that hinder our individual and collective development. **The Wim Hof ​​Method**  has helped me awaken an ancestral capacity, I call this coherence with nature: "The Human Component". _The Fairtech Revolution_ combines this coherence, working across-discipline and rethinking resources to bring about genuine sustainability.

### Basically, how does **The Wim Hof ​​Method** work?

**The Wim Hof ​​Method** will condition your autonomic nervous system. This results in your immune system becoming more resilient. Conditioning, is a process of guided breathing techniques, focus and exposure to the cold.

The process trains your reactions, to accept _the elements_ rather than fight them.

### What is your personal experienced of **The Wim Hof ​​Method** ?

The first thing I noticed was better tolerance to the weather. Other changes that I noticed are: restful sleep. Increased creativity and improved concentration. Extra stamina for better physical sports performance. A reduction in recovery time after exercise. Increased determination to meet my goals – even enhanced perception in-bed!

There is nothing miraculous here. These qualities are already inside us. Continuous stress, work pressure: modernity in general, have us locked in negative patterns. <!-- Technically this is the: sympathetic autonomic nervous system. -->

We live with shallow breathing, tachycardia (fast heartbeat whilst resting) and sugar-highs. We are unable to relax long enough to give our body time to regenerate, and we get further away from our well-being. <!-- Technically this is the: parasympathetic autonomic nervous system. -->

When we take time to apply our focus, we can heal – **The Wim Hof ​​Method** is a straightforward means to get there.

### Anyone can do this!

This is not only for athletes, it is within your reach too. It is a change of mind – not super-powers! The paradox of comfort is by living in a constant warm temperature we deactivate capabilities we all have.
