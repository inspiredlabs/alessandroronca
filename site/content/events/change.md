### What is change?
#### Description

Change is different for everyone. Although, we all desire some sort of transformation. Does your _comfort zone_ still bring peace of mind?

Being bold enough to change our mind, can be difficult. To discover new horizons, we must understand how behavior directs our habits. Doing so, helps us recognise opportunities and interpret our ambitions afresh.

#### Practical participation

- Planning exercises with people who have implemented alternatives for themselves.
- Help interpreting opportunities that will broaden your horizon.
- Get to know people in the same situation.
