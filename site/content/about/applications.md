Applying engineering principles across developing countries has helped me discover inventive ways to  deliver the right solution. In this area, my work aims to achieve maximum effect and conciously allocate resources. 

The following applications are low-resource, 
low-impediment and often exceptionally cheap. All these implementations are available for hands-on inspection at **PeR**. 

<!--##### Inventions-->

*   **"First rain" Tank**:
    *   A water pre-filter shouldn't be a barrier to drinking freely available water from the sky.
    *   To capture rain water, you must dispense the first few millimeters because of unwanted contaminants. Correct<!--, and clever--> rainwater harvesting can lower your exposure to pollution found in other water sources. 
    *   The capacity of the _"First rain"  Tank_ is calculated by measuring the roof. For every 1mm of rain there needs to be 100m square surface capture(read more on [Wikipedia](https://www.appropedia.org/Basic_rainwater_collection_calculations)).
    *   It works using a reverse plug. This mechnaism is a simple boyancy device, a football will do!
    *   When the tank is full, water flows over the plug into a second filter tank. The water is already free from airborne grit.
*   **Dehydrator**: The _Ettore_ is a solar drier, unique for its simplicity.
*   **Solar Irrigator**: The _Movotubo_ is a self-supplying concealed water conservation planter. A  wicking system makes for low-to-no intervention feeder where plants draw only what they need. Just as nature intended.
*   **Compost planter**: _Orto Autoirrigante_. A highly efficient mini-composting unit.
*   Modular housing framework: _YouB_ (an extension of the architectural design behind **PeR**).
*   **Emergancy Box**: A zero-maintainence evacuation kit for families who understand the value of _Emergancy Preparedness_.
*   **Light Bike**: for the democratic rider.
    *   A standard vehicle, lighter than the rider and powered enteriely by the sun.
    *   A prototype folding assembly to mount the solar panels. This can charge the bike’s battery when you stop for a midday rest and packs neatly into the pannier with your survival gear.
    *   The **Light Bike** makes it’s television debut on **Rai 1** on the 7th December on **Linea Verde**.

*   **Yousful**: a self-help method for problem solving. _Imprevisto Previsto_ – Predict the Unexpected! Knowns and unknowns surround our everyday circumstances. This course aims to increasing your own durability, independence and safety in the modern urban environment.
