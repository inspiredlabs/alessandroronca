*   First rain capture tank. Water pre-filter:
    *   The capacity of the _First rain capture tank_ is calculated by measuring the roof. For every 1mm of rain there needs to be 100m square surface capture(read more on [Wikipedia](https://www.appropedia.org/Basic_rainwater_collection_calculations)).
    *   It works using a reverse plug. This mechnaism is a simple boyancy device, a football will do!
    *   When the tank is full, water flows over the plug into a second filter tank. The water is already free from airborne grit.
*   Ettore. A solar drier, unique for its simplicity.
*   Self-supplying Solar Irrigator: The _Movotubo_. A wicked planter with a concealed water-table that is self-supplying without further intervention.
*   Compost planter: Orto Autoirrigante. A highly efficient mini-composting unit.
*   YouB. A modular housing framework.
*   Emergancy Box. A zero-maintainence evacuation kit for families who understand the value of _Emergancy Preparedness_.
*   The Light Bike:
    *   Intended for the democratic rider, it is a standard vehicle, lighter than the rider and powered enteriely by the sun.
    *   Alessandro created a prototype folding assembly to mount the solar panels. This can charge the bike’s battery when you stop for a midday rest and packs neatly into the pannier with your survival gear.
    *   The **Light Bike** makes it’s television debut on **Rai 1** on the 7th December on **Linea Verde**.
