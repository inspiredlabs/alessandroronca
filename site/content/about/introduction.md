As well as being a **Cerftified Wim Hof Method Instructor** based in Italy, I teach how to integrate energy technologies into your business, and home.

People looking to overcome burn out, improve their focus and seek proven time management skills. Although, all can benefit from innovative insights I have been exposed to.

Through facilitating sessions, I have coached numerous personalities, executives and authors helping to define life strategies to meet the most ambitious goals.
