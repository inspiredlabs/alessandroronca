<!--#### Alessandro Ronca's Biography -->

##### International Development

Using engineering to alleviate difficult environmental situations, I have worked in Africa and Central America, before becoming a Diving Instructor and exploring The Indian Ocean.

##### Sustainable development

Knowing there was important lessons to share in what I had learned so far, my next challenge was obvious. I sought advocates to help me test the idea… and eventually _we_ began to design and develop an independent sustainability research center based around energy techologies. This became known as <span lang="it">Il Parco Dell'Energia Rinnovabile</span>, or **PeR** for short. This has been an incredibly complicated process.

##### Now

Based deep in the heart of Italy our sustainability research center has become a relaxing oasis – but it wasn't always like this.

##### Then

There's much more going on than just an interesting building in a beautiful, tranquil setting.

During the management of **PeR**, it became apparent to me: technology over-promises and under delivers. I realised, Humanity has made a lot of progress – but it has become too intensive.

> Humanity’s footprint sinks under its own weight! <cite>– Alessandro Ronca on progress becoming needlessly intensive.</cite>

_Conscious Resource Allocation_ became critical to the success of the center. By being mindful of supply-needs, we developed systems without sacrificing comfort. As **PeR** evolved, so did society's environomental concerns. Today, it is accepted there is Climate Crisis.

> The true value of technology to Humanity is when it provides more benefit than cost, this can only be achieved in equilibrium with our environment. <cite>– Alessandro Ronca on technology</cite>

##### Man and planet in harmony

To act in coherence with nature, we must use engineering, the natural sciences and also practice developing our own, inner-technology. I call this: _The Human Component_.

_The Human Component_ is to live fully, in coherence with nature. It is the correct use of our mind and body to improve well-being be happy and live better. It is focus – it guides our efforts.

**The Wim Hof Method** helped me face cold, harsh winters, develop focus and strengthen my creativity. Now, I want to share this knowledge for other's to benefit.
