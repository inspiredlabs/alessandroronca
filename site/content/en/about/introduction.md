##### Training Facilitator &amp; Life-coach

<!--As a Training Facilitator, -->My goal is to improve your circumstances. I run a [range](https://www.per.umbria.it/i-nostri-corsi/) of sustainability courses such as _Change your job. Change your life_ to give people answers that unlock their potential. 

##### Sustainability Veteran

As well as being a **Cerftified Wim Hof Method Instructor** based in Italy, I teach how to integrate energy technologies into your business, and home. These activities are conducted from the Sustainability Research Center called: [Il Parco dell’ Energia Rinnovabile](https://per.umbria.it/), where I am the [Scientific Director](https://rvo.lt/knowledgeshare/alessandro-ronca/).

##### Who do I coach?

People looking to overcome burn out, improve their focus and seek proven time management skills. Although, all can benefit from innovative insights I have been exposed to.

Through facilitating sessions, I have coached numerous personalities, executives and authors helping to define life strategies to meet the most ambitious goals.
