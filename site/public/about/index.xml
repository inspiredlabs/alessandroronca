      <description>Training Facilitator &amp;amp; Life-coach My goal is to improve your circumstances. I run a range of sustainability courses such as Change your job. Change your life to give people answers that unlock thier potential.
Sustainability Veteran As well as being a Cerftified Wim Hof Method Instructor based in Italy, I teach how to integrate energy technologies into your business, and home. These activities are conducted from the Sustainability Research Center called: Il Parco dell’ Energia Rinnovabile, where I am the Scientific Director.</description>

      <description>International Development Using engineering to alleviate difficult environmental situations, I have worked in Africa and Central America, before becoming a Diving Instructor and exploring The Indian Ocean.
Sustainable development Knowing there was important lessons to share in what I had learned so far, my next challenge was obvious. I sought advocates to help me test the idea… and eventually we began to design and develop an independent sustainability research center based around energy techologies.</description>

      <description>Applying engineering principles across developing countries has helped me discover inventive ways to deliver the right solution. In this area, my work aims to achieve maximum effect and conciously allocate resources.
The following applications are low-resource, low-impediment and often exceptionally cheap. All these implementations are available for hands-on inspection at PeR.
 &amp;ldquo;First rain&amp;rdquo; Tank:  A water pre-filter shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a barrier to drinking freely available water from the sky.</description>
