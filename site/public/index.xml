      <description>Scientifically how does The Wim Hof Method really work? Using empirical evidence built up over decades, The Wim Hof Method has proven to have numerous benefits. Wim Hof challenged doctors, and became the subject of ground-breaking research into the body&amp;rsquo;s natural healing capability.
Formal study into Wim Hof began in 2011 at The University Medical Center St. Radboud, Nijmegen, Netherlands.
From then on the numerous health benefits of cold exposure and meditation have started to be understood.</description>

      <description>International Development Using engineering to alleviate difficult environmental situations, I have worked in Africa and Central America, before becoming a Diving Instructor and exploring The Indian Ocean.
Sustainable development Knowing there was important lessons to share in what I had learned so far, my next challenge was obvious. I sought advocates to help me test the idea… and eventually we began to design and develop an independent sustainability research center based around energy techologies.</description>

      <description>Applying engineering principles across developing countries has helped me discover inventive ways to deliver the right solution. In this area, my work aims to achieve maximum effect and conciously allocate resources.
The following applications are low-resource, low-impediment and often exceptionally cheap. All these implementations are available for hands-on inspection at PeR.
